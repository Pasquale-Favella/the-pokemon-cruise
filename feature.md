# Chatbot for Pokemon Cruise Booking

## Feature Description

Implement a chatbot using `transformers.js` (Xenova Transformers) to assist users with booking Pokemon cruises. The chatbot will provide information about cruises, help users navigate the booking process, and answer related questions.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Installation:** Install the `@huggingface/transformers` library using npm.
    ```bash
    npm install @huggingface/transformers
    ```
2.  **Chatbot Component:** Create a new React component (e.g., `Chatbot.tsx`) for the chatbot user interface. This component will include:
    *   An input field for users to type their messages.
    *   A display area to show the conversation history (user messages and chatbot responses).
    *   A button to send messages.
3.  **Web Worker:** Create a Web Worker (`worker.js`) to handle the heavy lifting of running the text generation model. This will prevent the main browser thread from freezing.
    *   The worker will import the `pipeline` function from `@huggingface/transformers`.
    *   It will load a pre-trained text generation model suitable for conversational AI.
    *   It will listen for messages from the main thread containing user input.
    *   Upon receiving a message, it will use the loaded pipeline to generate a response based on the conversation history and the user's input.
    *   It will send the generated response back to the main thread.
4.  **Main Thread Integration:** In the `Chatbot.tsx` component:
    *   Create a new `Worker` instance.
    *   Set up an event listener to receive messages from the worker. When a message is received, update the chat history state.
    *   Implement a function to send user messages to the worker using `worker.postMessage()`.
    *   Consider implementing streaming of responses from the worker for a better user experience.
5.  **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate text generation model from the Hugging Face Hub. The model should be capable of understanding conversational context and generating informative responses related to Pokemon cruises.
6.  **Integration into Application:** Integrate the `Chatbot` component into the relevant part of the application, likely on the booking or cruise details pages.

## Potential Models

*   Explore text generation models available on the Hugging Face Hub that are compatible with `transformers.js` and suitable for conversational tasks.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more sophisticated conversation management, including memory and context handling.
*   Integrate with the application's booking system to allow the chatbot to perform actions like checking cruise availability or initiating a booking.
*   Improve natural language understanding to handle a wider range of user queries.
*   Add support for multi-modal input (e.g., voice).
