# Pokemon Cruise Booking App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

*   **Purpose:** To create a web application that allows users to browse and book cruises with a rich Pokemon lore theme.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Provide a smooth and intuitive booking experience, similar to popular travel booking platforms like Booking.com or Airbnb.
    *   Integrate Pokemon lore and aesthetics throughout the application's design and user experience.
    *   Utilize Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing interface.
*   **Vision:** To become the leading platform for fans to discover and book unique, immersive cruise experiences inspired by the world of Pokemon.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Cruise Listing:**
    *   Display a list of available cruises.
    *   Each cruise listing should include:
        *   Cruise name (incorporating Pokemon lore, e.g., SS Anne, Olympic Aqua).
        *   Region the cruise explores (e.g., Kanto, Johto).
        *   A brief description.
        *   Key highlights or themes.
        *   Starting price.
*   **Cruise Detail Page:**

    *   Include:
        *   Detailed description of the cruise and its theme.
        *   Full itinerary with dates and ports of call.
        *   Pokemon-themed map visualizing the cruise route and points of interest within the region.
        *   Information about onboard activities and amenities (themed around Pokemon where possible).
        *   Details on available cabin types, pricing, and availability.
        *   Gallery of images (ship, cabins, activities, themed areas).

        *   Technical Hints:
            *   Consider using a JavaScript mapping library like Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS for rendering and interactivity.
            *   Alternatively, a custom SVG map could be created and manipulated with JavaScript for a highly stylized Pokemon look.
            *   Integrate map data with the cruise details fetched from the mock data (or later, the backend API).
*   **Custom Checkout Process:**
    *   A multi-step, themed checkout flow.

        *   Payment processing.
    *   The design and language used in the checkout process should align with the overall Pokemon theme.

## 3. Design and User Experience

*   **Look and Feel:** The application should have a clean, modern, and intuitive interface, drawing inspiration from the user-friendly design of platforms like Booking.com and Airbnb.
*   **Pokemon Lore Integration:**
    *   Visual design elements (colors, typography, icons, illustrations) should be inspired by the Pokemon universe.
    *   Cruise names, descriptions, and potentially cabin types should reference Pokemon regions, characters, or events.
    *   The map visualization on the detail page should be a custom, Pokemon-styled map of the cruise region.
    *   Terminology used throughout the app should resonate with Pokemon fans.
*   **Smoothness and Performance:** The application should be fast, responsive, and provide a seamless user experience across different devices. Animations and transitions should be smooth and enhance the user journey.
*   **Accessibility:** Design and develop with accessibility standards in mind to ensure the app is usable by a wide audience.

## 4. Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript for a robust and scalable React application.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for efficient and consistent styling, enabling rapid UI development and easy customization.
*   **UI Components:** Mandatory use of Shadcn UI components, styled with a custom Pokemon-tailored palette to ensure consistency and adherence to the theme. The palette will be customized by overriding CSS variables as described in the Shadcn UI theming documentation.
*   **State Management:** Jotai for simple and flexible client-side state management.
*   **Data:** Initially, use generated mock data for development and demonstration purposes.
*   **Backend/API:** A backend will be required to manage cruise data, bookings, user authentication (if implemented), and payment processing. (Specific technology stack to be determined).
*   **Data Storage:** A database will be needed to store cruise information, user data, and booking records. (Specific database technology to be determined).
*   **Deployment:** The application should be deployable to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

## 5. Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   User accounts and profiles to manage past and upcoming bookings.
*   Integration with external APIs for real-time data (e.g., weather forecasts at ports of call).
*   Pokemon-themed interactive elements or mini-games within the app to enhance engagement.
*   Push notifications for booking confirmations, reminders, or special offers.
*   Search and filtering options based on region, dates, price range, etc.
*   Customer reviews and ratings for cruises.
